The recommended level is generally 7.5% but targets are individual and your paediatric diabetes team may suggest a different target for you. The measurement units for HbA1c have recently changed from percentage (7.5%) to mmol/mol (58mmol/l). The test and its meaning are the same, but the numbers are different.
