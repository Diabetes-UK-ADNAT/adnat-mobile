I do 
know    
What is HbA1c? As well as the day-to-day blood glucose testing, 
there is another test that monitors your diabetes management. 
The HbA1c test (usually done from a fingertip blood test either 
at the clinic or just before your appointment) measures your 
diabetes control over the last two to three months. The 
recommended level is generally 7.5% but targets are individual 
and your paediatric diabetes team may suggest a different 
target for you. The measurement units for HbA1c have recently 
changed from percentage (7.5%) to mmol/mol (58mmol/l). The 
test and its meaning are the same, but the numbers are 
different. The change has been made so that HbA1c around the 
world is reported in the same way.
